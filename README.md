# ap_pipe-notebooks
A repository for notebooks and other useful code intended to  analyze 
and troublueshoot various ap_pipe processing runs.

**data**: Known variables in the HiTS 2015 dataset, from the HiTS DR1

**false_positives**: Work during the June 2019 sprint to characterize false positives in difference imaging

*Note:* [RFC-642](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/RFC-642) renamed PPDB
into APDB, many module names and method names have changed as a result.
Python modules in this package have been updated for that change but notebooks
have not been changed. This can potentially break some or all notebooks,
be prepared to update them.
