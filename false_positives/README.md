# False Positives
A landing place for work done during the June 2019 sprint to better understand
false positives in difference imaging.

*Note:* [RFC-642](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/RFC-642) renamed PPDB
into APDB, many module names and method names have changed as a result.
Python modules in this package have been updated for that change but notebooks
have not been changed. This can potentially break some or all notebooks,
be prepared to update them.
